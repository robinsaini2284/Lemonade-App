# 🍋Lemonade App

A simple, fun Android app built with Jetpack Compose that simulates the steps of making a glass of lemonade — from picking lemons to enjoying a refreshing drink!

📱 Overview

The Lemonade App is an interactive and visually engaging Android application created using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It teaches the Compose UI fundamentals in a playful way by guiding the user through four steps of lemonade making:

Pick a Lemon – Tap the lemon tree to pick a lemon.

Squeeze the Lemon – Tap the lemon multiple times to simulate squeezing.

Drink the Lemonade – Enjoy your freshly made drink.

Restart – Empty glass indicates it's time to make another one!

Each tap changes the image and message, helping users understand state management in Compose.
